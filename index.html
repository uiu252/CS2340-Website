<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>WanderSync: A Collaborative Travel Management System simplifies creating and managing travel itineraries for solo and group travelers.
  Using a user friendly interface, the app allows users organize destinations, transportation schedules, accommodations, dining reservations, and personal notes.
  The key features of the app are ecure account creation, real-time collaboration tools for group planning, and seamless integration of travel details. 
  Users can share notes, create shared agendas, and synchronize updates across all group members.
  The project took 4 sprints, where the group focused on builiding the core features of the app, 
  while following differect programming best practices and patterns. Diagrams were made to better organize and 
  visualize the system.
 </p>


<h2 id="design-arch">Design & Architecture</h2>
<p>To better understand the system and to be able to organize it visually,
  we made a Domain Model, Design Class Diagram, and Use Case Digram.

<h4>Design Patterns</h4>

<h5> Singleton Pattern</h5>
<p>Singleton ensures that a class can only have one instance and provides global access for that
  instance. We implement Singleton with FirestoreManager as the constructor is private and we
  have a public static method for getting an instance of FirestoreManager, ensuring that there can
  only be a single instance. We use FirestoreManager to manage our user and destination database
  and perform FirestoreManager.getInstance() when saving a userâ€™s data to database and
  destination information. This method will always return the same instance of FirestoreManager
  allowing for consistent interactions and thread safety</p>

<h5>MVVM Architecture</h5>

<ul>
  <li>View: Represents the UI elements that are displayed to the user. It is responsible for presenting the data to the user.
    This contains the buttons, text fields, and UI components.
  </li>

  <li>ViewModel: Acts as the middle layer that allows for communication between the View and Model.
    This contains logic for registering and adding users, allowing users to post to the forum, 
    and for users to log their travels. </li>

  <li>Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. 
    This contains data related to travel itinerary data, user information, and our database.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Observer Pattern</h5>

<p>In our code, the Observer Pattern was used to manage updates to the users reservations. The
  DiningActivity class acts as the subject, and it maintains a list of observers, such as
  ReservationsObserver, which listens for changes in the reservations list. DiningActivity notifies
  all the observers when new reservations are added or existing ones are modified, and the app will
  then update the UI to reflect these changes. Components can subscribe to updates by using the
  addObserver() method and unsubscribe by using removeObserver(). The notifyObservers()
  method notifies the subscribed observers with the updated reservations. A similar method was
  employed for the AccomodationActivity class.</p>

<h2 id="ui">User Interface</h2>
<p>The main screens for the WanderSync app are: Logistics, Accomodations, Dining, Location, Forum
  and the login page.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The project outcomes were to work collaboratively as a group to create Wandersync and give it all of the functionalities of each screen of the app that are shown above. For example, users should be able to create and add to their trips with new upcoming destinations and the accommodations of where they are staying. They can also invite other users and collaborate through the travel forum page which allows anyone in the group to edit their trip. The biggest challenge was implementing the collaborator functionality and making it so that users that are invited to the same trip group will have the same updated information displayed. We accomplished this by creating a tripID that can be used to connect the users with all of their firestore collections. Another challenge was time management and working together as a group which was the most important knowledge we gained throughout this project. We learned how to keep everyone updated and worked together as a team. The members discuss the functionalities they have completed or need help on and communicate their plans for the next step. 
  The rest of the team would then share their opinions and list out requirements that need to be implemented and what they can contribute. 
  Overall, the project was a valuable experience for everyone on the team.</p>
